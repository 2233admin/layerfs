//! Delta bases for the chunks of an edited chunked file, by byte range.
//!
//! An edit keeps the base's extents on both sides of each replaced range and
//! scans only the replacement into new chunks. Each new chunk is offered, as its
//! advisory delta base, the old payload whose byte range overlaps the chunk's,
//! measured from an alignment between new and old positions. The alignment is
//! anchored at every unchanged neighbour: each edit's two boundaries, and every
//! new chunk equal to an old payload (content-defined chunking resynchronises
//! after an insert or a delete, so the chunks after it repeat the old ones at a
//! shifted position). A chunk with no overlapping old payload is offered the
//! successor of the nearest unchanged neighbour. Chunk index plays no part: an
//! early insert shifts every later index.
//!
//! The base's mapping is walked forward once, holding at most [`WINDOW`] old
//! extents and one mapping page; nothing grows with the file. A hint is
//! advisory: Storage decides whether a delta against it is stored.
