//! Canonical bytes a Save already resolved, kept within a byte bound (#364).
//!
//! An object's identity is the hash of its canonical bytes, so a kept value is
//! exactly what resolving the same identity again would return: it was
//! authenticated when first resolved. Keeping it skips that object's delta
//! chain, decompression and hash on every later read in the same Save. The
//! least recently read values are released first; a released value is
//! resolved again when asked, so the bound costs work and never correctness.
